# YZT Curricula

Welcome to the YZT Curricula! YZT values your time and learning motivation. For encouraging your studies and eliminating frictions, we form various curricula to enhance your learning experience.

_The pace between tracks may differ. The deadlines are based on our starting date, January 27, 2025._

## Introduction

Although this document is oriented for Middle East Technical University (METU) undergrads, it is not exclusive. **This resource is for anyone would love to learn.**

**Biggest prerequisite for us:** Besides from the essential math knowledge; having enthusiasm, and courage to carry on are crucial. If you have these two, you are a great candidate. Your department, age, or school does not matter.

### What Will We Do?

Every curriculum has its own deadlines and tasks. 
By the end of February 16, the end of the semester holiday, different learning groups will finalize the [Python Course](cs50.harvard.edu/python) and the [Gen AI Intensive Course.](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai) The following content shows what will be covered by the first half of 2024–2025 spring semester.

## One-For-All Track

This track has one goal, teaching you the programming essentials. Whether you will be a philosopher, an artist, or an FBI agent; you **must** learn algorithmic thinking.

Be mindful for the _duration_ and _effort_ columns. They are merely estimate and vary for each person.

| Course Name | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites | Our Deadline |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python) | 10 weeks | 3-9 hours per week | high school math | 3 weeks, until February 16 |
| [(Optional) MITx: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python) | 9 Weeks | 14-16 hours per week | high school math | - |

### Who Should Take One-For-All Track?

If you participated some of our face-to-face lessons and/or the Python Course throughout the 2024–2025 fall semester, you are encouraged to finalize the Python Course. You will have a firm understanding and sufficient practice if you are going to take CENG240 in the spring semester.

## TT Starter Track

Technical Team (TT) has two distinct groups; _Learning,_ and _Project._ Learning Group consists of members who are willing to devote more time to specialize on various areas such as machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, or computer vision. If you are a TT member or a TT candidate, you must join our Slack to participate while learning.

| Course Name | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites | Our Deadline |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| (Faster pace than One-For-All Track) [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python) | 10 weeks | 3-9 hours per week | high school math | 1 week, until February 2 |
| [5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai) | 5 days | 4-6 hours per day | [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python) or equivalent experience | 1 week, until February 9 |
| [MIT 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning](https://introtodeeplearning.com/) (you can find the lecture videos from its youtube channel if 2025 versions are not uploaded yet) | 3 weeks | 2 lectures and 1 software lab per week | [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python) or equivalent experience | 3 weeks, until March 2 |

### Who Should Take TT Starter Track?
If you are in our TT Learning Group, you must follow this track. By the end of it, you will be able to work on AI projects and join the TT Project Group.

## TT Intense Track

This track requires rigorous prerequisites. Thus, the curriculum consists various courses to scaffold your math skills. You don't have to finish all the math courses, but Inzva Syllabus assumes you have the essentials. If you are a METU engineering undergrad, you may skip _Essence of Linear Algebra_ and _Essence of Calculus_ courses.

### Who Should Take TT Intense Track?

If you have completed the TT Starter Track, you may take it. TT Intense Track is basically a minor program like the official METU minor programs. The track is not sacred, but it is recommended if you consider a career in AI field.
